The files in /model_inputs/ calculate the age structure, clinical fraction, and contact matrices for the analysis, alternatively the outputs from these files are also in /data/. 

Results of the study are produced in files in /outcomes/, mainly in results.R. loading_data.R is sourced at the start of these files, which loads many of the necessary files and functions. The epidemic model is in SEIRD_model.R.
